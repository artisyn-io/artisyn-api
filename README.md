# Artisyn.io Backend API

## Find Artisans Near You

Artisyn is a decentralised protocol built on Stellar that connects local artisans with users through community-curated listings. Our platform creates a trustless ecosystem where skilled workers can be discovered, verified, and compensated securely without relying on centralised intermediaries.

Many artisans lack a platform to help them get noticed; meanwhile, numerous people would appreciate quality artisan recommendations—the kind we aim to provide. Our vision is to be the bridge connecting both worlds.
